# Why I built this
This is a pretty simple app and that is why I choose it. I am using it to learn the following technologies and/or techniques:
- TypeScript
- BEM 
- SASS
- DRY principle
- UML diagramming

## Inspiration
I saw it in one of Udacity's course quiz and decided to build it out with technologies I was interested in learn
